title: Serverless Gardens at the Serverless Sydney Meetup
description: >
  I presented this talk at the Serverless Sydney meetup.
  I focus on explaining what I had built, the choices I made and what I learnt.
  We were a bit short on time, but it was a fun night with lots of questions at the end.

This talk will cover how I architected a Serverless monitoring system for my garden.
I dive into React + GraphQL + Lambda + DynamoDB stack that powers my garden dashboard.
