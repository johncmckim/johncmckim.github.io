title: Serverless Gardens at BrisJS
description: >
  I presented this talk at the BrisJS meetup.
  I introduced Serverless and demonstrated an example Serverless project. It was a great night with lots of questions at the end.

This talk will cover how I architected a Serverless monitoring system for my garden.
I dive into React + GraphQL + Lambda + DynamoDB stack that powers my garden dashboard.
